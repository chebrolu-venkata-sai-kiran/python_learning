async allows your program to multitask efficiently by switching between tasks while waiting for 
slow operations to finish, instead of stopping everything

it has the keywords of async , await and eventloop 

Non-daemon threads prevent the program from exiting until they finish their task, 
whereas daemon threads are background services 
that are abruptly terminated as soon as all non-daemon threads have completed.
