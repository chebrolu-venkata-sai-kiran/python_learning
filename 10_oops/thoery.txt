the blue print if the class and the instanse of the blue print is called as object in python

class is also an object in python

each object is having the the own entity which is called namespaces

inside the class whenever the variable goes it is called properties

we can change the properties of the objects it will not have the impact on the class by default 

the vairables inside the class and objects are called as the attibute

if we create the functions in the classed those are called as the methods with the self arguments

constructor are created using __init__ it means it is to initalize the methods when ever we are creating an object 
this init method will be called 

__init__ is a special method in Python classes that is called when an object is created from the class.

Inheritance is used where a class wants to derive the nature of parent class and then modify or extend the
functionality of it. Inheritance will extend the functionality with extra features allows overriding of methods, 
but in the case of Composition, we can only use that class we can not modify or extend the functionality of it. 
It will not provide extra features. Thus, when one needs to use the class as it without any modification, the 
composition is recommended and when one needs to change the behavior of the method in another class, 
then inheritance is recommended.
